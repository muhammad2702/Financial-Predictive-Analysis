This code is an example of using the XGBoost algorithm for binary classification and evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics. Here is a breakdown of what the code does:

The necessary libraries are imported: sklearn.metrics for evaluation metrics, pandas for data manipulation, xgboost for the XGBoost algorithm, and numpy for array operations.
Two datasets are loaded: Shifted_price_data.csv as the target labels for future prices and filtered_prices.csv as the historical data with processed noise.
The 'Sign' column from filtered_prices.csv is extracted as the input feature Price_data.
The value Denom is computed as a scaling factor.
The input feature Price_data is scaled by dividing each value by Denom.
The target labels are converted to a binary format, where -1 becomes 0 and all other values remain the same.
The data is converted to NumPy arrays for compatibility with XGBoost.
The Price_data_numpy array is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
The input data is reshaped to match the required format for XGBoost.
The data is split into training and testing sets using a 90:10 ratio.
An XGBoost classifier is created and trained on the training data.
The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data.
The predicted labels are rounded to obtain binary predictions.
Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score are calculated based on the predicted labels and true labels.
The evaluation metrics are printed to the console.
